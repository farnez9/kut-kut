# Kut-Kut — overview

**Last updated:** 2026-04-21 (session 16 shipped)

## Product

A general-purpose, local-first authoring tool for 2D and 3D animated videos. You define animations as code in this repo, iterate live in a Solid.js studio via Vite HMR, and export an mp4 entirely client-side through WebCodecs. Typical use: explainer, educational, short-form social, marketing — anything where a scripted, programmable pipeline beats a heavy GUI editor. **The engine is content-agnostic; no templates ship.**

### How you use it

1. Create `projects/<name>/scene.ts` (and optionally `timeline.json`, `overlay.json`, `assets/`).
2. Run `bun run dev`.
3. The studio lists projects and loads the one you pick. Preview updates via HMR as you edit `scene.ts`. GUI edits write back to disk through a Vite dev plugin.
4. Click Export → WebCodecs encodes → browser downloads `<name>.mp4`.

## Current state

**Engine.** Scene graph (`Node`/`Group`/`Transform`, 2D and 3D layers, `Rect` and `Box` primitives) with Solid-reactive properties. Project schema validated by valibot at v3, chained migrations from v1. Timeline model: `Track`/`Clip`/`Keyframe` per track kind (`number`, `audio`, `caption`), curated easings, pure `evaluateClip`/`evaluateTrack`/`evaluateCaptionTrack` (half-open `[start, end)`, later-start wins on overlap), `applyTimeline` resolving dotted node paths. `PlaybackController` with `play`/`pause`/`seek`/`restart`/`dispose` and `onTransition` callback (drift-free, SSR-safe). Renderer interface with Pixi 2D + Three 3D adapters composed via `createCompositor` (stacked canvases, WebGPU → WebGL fallback). Overlay v2 as a property-override + structural-op layer: `applyOverlay` + `applyNodeOps`, migration from v1. Audio: `AudioTrack`/`AudioClip`, `decodeAudio`, `computePeaks`, `createAudioPlayer` driven by `PlaybackController.onTransition`. Captions: pure SRT/VTT `parse`/`serialize` tolerating BOM, CRLF, `,`/`.` fractions and VTT preamble/NOTE/STYLE/REGION blocks.

**Studio.** CSS-grid shell (topbar / sidebars / preview / bottom timeline) with aquamarine accent. Project slice lists `projects/` and dynamically imports `scene.ts`. Preview host mounts compositor, applies overlay + timeline per frame, rebuilds on structural overlay change via keyed `<Show>`. Interactive timeline: ruler, draggable playhead, clip drag, clip trim, keyframe drag (with reorder), easing glyphs, ctrl+wheel zoom, collapse toggle, 300 ms debounced single-flight persistence. Inspector: keyframe > node > clip selection precedence, transform editors (`NumberInput`, `Vec3Input`). Layers panel with add/delete/restore, unique-name picker. Record mode toggle (`R` hotkey) routes inspector commits to keyframes inside clip windows. Unified command store (cap 200) spans timeline + overlay; `⌘Z` / `⌘⇧Z` work across surfaces. Audio: `<AudioProvider>` owns decoded buffers + peaks keyed by `clip.src` (lazy `AudioContext`, decode-on-tracks-change), `<AudioPlayerHost>` mounts the engine player and calls `reconcile()` on buffer/track edits, timeline renders an audio row with inline mute + gain and a canvas waveform per clip. Both file import and microphone recording funnel through a shared `ingestAudioFile` tail (upload via plugin → decode → peaks → undoable `addAudioTrackCommand`); `<RecordButton>` drives MediaRecorder against live playback, clip `start` = playback time at record-begin. Audio clips are draggable and trimmable (body + left-handle + right-handle) with non-slip semantics on left-trim (shift `start` + `offset` by same delta); drags push `moveAudioClipCommand` / `resizeAudioClipLeftCommand` / `resizeAudioClipRightCommand` on `pointerup`, all undoable via the unified store. Caption tracks render as a dedicated row with drag + trim + double-click-to-edit (inline `<textarea>`, Esc cancels, Enter commits, Shift+Enter inserts newline); timeline header adds Add/Import/Export SRT·VTT; a DOM `<CaptionOverlay>` mounts in the preview (bottom-anchored, backdrop-blurred, `aria-live="polite"`) with a global `C` hotkey toggling visibility (localStorage-persisted via a `createRoot` signal).

**Plugin.** `apps/studio/vite/project-fs.ts` — endpoints: list projects, read project (timeline + overlay + asset manifest), write timeline, write overlay, upload asset. Path-safety via name regex + `path.relative` containment.

**Next session:** 17 — TTS adapters + panel (provider interface, WebSpeech adapter, ElevenLabs adapter, studio panel, plugin save).

## Architecture

See `plans/decisions/0001-architecture-choices.md` for locked decisions. Key split:

- **Engine** is headless (DOM use limited to `HTMLCanvasElement`, `AudioContext`, WebCodecs).
- **Studio** is Solid JSX + user interactions + plugin client. Imports only from `@kut-kut/engine`'s public entry.
- **Vite plugin** (`apps/studio/vite/`) round-trips GUI edits to `projects/<name>/`.

- **09** (2026-04-19) Scene overlay v1 + inspector editing: `overlay.json` property overrides, engine `applyOverlay` pipeline, plugin endpoint + studio slice, transform editors, timeline collapse toggle. → ADR 0006
- **10** (2026-04-19) Scene node create/delete (overlay v2) + Layers panel: `additions`/`deletions`, `applyNodeOps`, panel with tree + add/delete/restore, `<Show keyed>` remount on structural change. → ADR 0007
- **11** (2026-04-19) Record mode + unified undo: record-mode toggle, generalized command store spanning timeline + overlay, inspector→keyframe routing, ⌘Z across surfaces. → ADR 0008
- **12** (2026-04-19) Audio core: `AudioTrack`/`AudioClip`, schema v2 + migration, `decodeAudio`, `computePeaks`, `createAudioPlayer` routed through per-track gain nodes, playback sync via `onTransition`. → ADR 0009
- **13** (2026-04-20) Studio audio panel: `<AudioProvider>` (lazy `AudioContext`, buffers/peaks by `clip.src`, decode-on-tracks-change), `<AudioPlayerHost>` (lazy player + `reconcile()` seam), audio timeline row with inline mute/gain + canvas waveform, import button (plugin upload → decode → undoable add-track). → ADR 0010
- **14** (2026-04-21) Voiceover recording: `MediaRecorder` wired to live playback (clip `start` = playback time at record-begin), shared `ingestAudioFile` tail with import, `<RecordButton>` with elapsed timer + feature-detect fallback, pure helpers (`pickRecordingMime`, `extensionForMime`, `makeRecordingFilename`).
- **15** (2026-04-21) Audio clip editing: body drag + left/right trim on audio clips with non-slip semantics (left-trim shifts `start` + `offset` by the same delta), three raw setters on `TimelineContext` + matching undoable commands, buffer-length + `MIN_CLIP_SEC` clamps at the call site, waveform already offset-aware from session 13.
- **16** (2026-04-21) Captions: engine `CaptionTrack`/`CaptionClip` + schema v3 migration, pure SRT/VTT parse+serialize (tolerates BOM/CRLF/`,`·`.`/VTT preamble), timeline caption row with drag/trim/inline textarea editor and Add·Import·Export SRT·VTT header buttons, DOM `<CaptionOverlay>` in the preview with global `C` hotkey.

## Performance & memory budgets

- **Live preview:** 60 fps at 1080p on mid-tier Chromium. Scene graph updates flow through Solid signals only — no per-frame reconciliation.
- **Timeline memory:** ~10 min × ~6 tracks × ~20 clips × ~10 keyframes ≈ plain arrays. No virtualization in v1.
- **Audio waveform:** compute peaks once on import; cache in `projects/<name>/assets/.peaks/` keyed by file hash.
- **Export:** 1080p 30 fps × 10 min ≈ 18 000 frames. WebCodecs target: ≤3× realtime.

## Open questions

- **Pixi + Three compositor** stays as stacked canvases for v1. Sharing a `GPUDevice` across both libs is possible but fiddly — revisit with a spike before session 17 (export).
- **Vec3 sub-component keyframes.** `applyTimeline` can't animate `transform.position.x` via `NumberTrack` today. Pick between resolver widening or property splitting when a real project needs it.

## Naming TBDs

- `@kut-kut/engine` is a placeholder scope. Rename at publish time if you use a different npm org.
- Project folders are plain directories — no custom extension.
